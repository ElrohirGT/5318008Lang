## How to develop this project

Honestly? You only need a Go compiler. But if you need anything else, we
recommend [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) and
[Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes)! Then you can simply run:

```bash
nix develop # Enters a devshell with a go compiler and other goodies (like a debugger)
```

Once you have your environment ready, you can run the project with:

```bash
go run .

go test ./...
```

**Want to change the grammar?**

For that, you should have [antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) installed.
Once its ready, modify the file `compiscript/program/Compiscript.g4` and run
this command in the root of the repo:

```bash
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Go -Xexact-output-dir -o ./parser compiscript/program/Compiscript.g4
```

### Fuzzing

Fuzzing has been implemented, checkout for fuzz tests under the
`./tests/fuzzTests/` folder. You can only run one test at a time with:

```bash
go test ./tests/fuzzTests/random_bytes/ -fuzz=Fuzz
```

Specifying the folder test directory each time! Make sure to run them from the
root of the repository.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compiscript     // Gramar language definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ parser          // Parser module (Generated with ANTLR)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ listener        // The CORE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib             // Utility function an types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests           // Tests for the diff
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gui             // Awesome GUI ‚ú®
```

## üß™ Testing

Almost all project tests are defined under the directory `./tests/`. Every file
you find here is divided in two:

```
// Basic CPS file
let a: string = "Hola";
---
// Expected compiler output
```

When you execute `go test` it executes a single test that reads all these files
and compares the output of the compiler with the expected output defined below
the `---`, if this differ in any way it reports an error. Easy way to get a big
pile of tests going.

### Linting

To lint the project simply run:

```bash
golangci-lint run ./...
```

### Semantic Analysis

This phase of the code follows the lexical which mean: "The code follows the
desired structure, but does it actually make sense?" In this phase we check
primarily for correctnes in 2 aspects:

- **Types**
- **Scopes**

But the check for those we first need to define how our program represents them,
and interact with the code. In this phase this are the primary modules:
